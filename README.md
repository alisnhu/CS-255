Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

If we detail this system, it is a system where users can prepare for the driving license exam with the basic lines that the client wants.
We can define the entire system that the user wants as follows:
Preparation documents: a collection of documents that users can prepare and read
Preparation Tests: Sample exams where they can test themselves before the real exam
Online courses: online courses that users can attend
Driving lessons: 2-hour driving lessons that users can take according to their packages
Preparation lesson: live pre-exam training – briefing
The customer wants these features to be allowed in certain packages.
Package One: Six hours in a car with a trainer
Package Two: Eight hours in a car with a trainer and an in-person lesson where we explain the DMV rules and policies
Package Three: Twelve hours in a car with a trainer, an in-person lesson where we explain the DMV rules and policies—plus access to our online class with all the content and material. 
The online class also includes practice tests.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job, especially by designing each use case well and creating their activity diagrams without any errors.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
use case diagrami kismina geri doner ve bunlari her bir islebi daha basit ve projenin her islevinin tek bir use case olacak sekilde yeniden tasarlardim

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs from a programmer's perspective within the scope of feasibility, cost, quality and time.
In other words, I first thought about the feasibility of a desired feature and then tried to design it in a way that would optimally meet its cost, quality and time requirements 
and which ones could be sacrificed.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I will apply many of the things I learned in this course to my future projects. Especially in this course,
I learned the importance of diagrams and how important they are for communication and coordination between software developers, 
and that they enable different developers to work on the same thing in the same way. 
If I combine this with the project management training I received before, I think I will be able to manage a very successful process.
